# music_recommendation
Building a Music Recommendation System for a Project @HSLU. It is based on a Kaggle Challange.

1. To run the solution, fork the code to your local machine
2. Create a develpment venv
3. Install required libraries according to the requirements.txt file: $ pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open jupyter with: $ jupyter notebook
5. First run the Data_Preprocessing.ipynb in the folder "Preprocessing" to generate some csv-files to run PMF and SVD later on
6. To run the code for PMF, open the folder PMF, open the file "PMF_Recommender_Systems.ipynb"
7. Then run the code blocks in the "PMF_Recommender_Systems.ipynb" and see the results
8. To run the code for SVD, open the folder SVD and the file "SVD.ipynb"
9. Then run the code blocks in the file "SVD.ipynb" and see the results
